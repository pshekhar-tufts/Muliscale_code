# Muliscale_code

This repository contains the python code for multiscale Algorithm. Main code is in multiscale_new.py. The Jupyter notebooks demonstrate the application on several datasets considered in the paper: A Forward Backward Greedy approach for Sparse Multiscale Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07068)
